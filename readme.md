# Nexora

### Autonomous AI for Evidence-Based Data Intelligence

> **Status: 🚧 Under Active Development**

Nexora is an AI-powered autonomous data intelligence platform designed to transform natural-language questions and raw datasets into **evidence-backed analysis, visualizations, insights, and recommendations**.

The project combines **Agentic AI, Data Science, Machine Learning, Statistical Analysis, Explainable AI, and Full-Stack Engineering** into a single production-oriented platform.

Nexora is currently in the early development stage. The architecture and core product are being built incrementally, with the goal of developing a complete AI-powered data scientist rather than a simple chatbot.

---

## What is Nexora?

Traditional AI data analysis can follow a simple pattern:

```text
Dataset → LLM → Answer
```

Nexora is being designed around a more rigorous Data Science workflow:

```text
Dataset
   ↓
Data Understanding
   ↓
Data Quality
   ↓
Analysis Planning
   ↓
Controlled Python Tools
   ↓
Statistical Validation
   ↓
Evidence
   ↓
Insights
   ↓
Visualization
   ↓
Recommendations
   ↓
Report
```

The core principle is:

> **The AI reasons about the analysis. Python performs the analysis.**

The LLM should determine what needs to be investigated, which tools should be used, which columns are relevant, and how the results should be interpreted.

Actual calculations, statistical tests, data processing, machine learning, and visualization preparation are performed by controlled Python tools.

---

# Vision

Nexora aims to become an **AI Data Scientist that can investigate data rather than simply talk about it.**

A user should eventually be able to upload a dataset and ask:

> **"Why did revenue decrease in Q3?"**

Instead of immediately generating an answer, Nexora should:

1. Understand the dataset.
2. Inspect its structure and quality.
3. Understand the user's question.
4. Create an analysis plan.
5. Select appropriate analytical tools.
6. Perform exploratory analysis.
7. Perform relevant statistical analysis.
8. Generate appropriate visualizations.
9. Investigate potential drivers.
10. Validate important findings.
11. Build evidence-backed insights.
12. Generate recommendations.
13. Present the analysis interactively.
14. Generate a professional report.

# Why Nexora?

Nexora is intentionally different from a generic AI chatbot.

The platform is being designed around five principles:

### 1. Evidence Before Conclusions

Important findings should be supported by actual analytical results.

### 2. LLMs Should Not Invent Numbers

The LLM should not calculate numerical results itself.

Python tools should perform the calculations.

### 3. Controlled Tool Execution

Agents should interact with predefined Data Science tools instead of executing arbitrary Python code.

### 4. Transparent Analysis

The system should make the analytical process inspectable.

```text
Question
   ↓
Analysis Plan
   ↓
Agent
   ↓
Tool
   ↓
Result
   ↓
Evidence
   ↓
Insight
```

### 5. Correlation Is Not Causation

Nexora should distinguish between:

* Observation
* Correlation
* Statistical association
* Prediction
* Causal claims

Causal claims should only be made when the methodology provides appropriate support.

---

# Main Product Modes

## AI Data Analyst

The first major mode focuses on autonomous data analysis.

Example questions:

```text
Why did sales decrease?

Which region performs best?

Which products generate the most revenue?

What factors are associated with customer churn?

Which customer segment has the highest value?

What caused the increase in operating costs?

Are there unusual patterns in the dataset?

What are the strongest relationships between variables?
```

The system should determine which analyses are relevant to the question instead of running every possible analysis.

---

## AI ML Scientist

A second mode will extend Nexora into machine learning.

Planned workflow:

```text
Dataset
   ↓
Data Quality
   ↓
Target Detection
   ↓
Feature Engineering
   ↓
Train/Test Split
   ↓
Model Selection
   ↓
Model Training
   ↓
Model Comparison
   ↓
Evaluation
   ↓
Explainability
   ↓
Prediction
```

Potential models include:

* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting
* XGBoost
* Other appropriate Scikit-learn models

Planned explainability capabilities:

* SHAP
* Feature Importance
* Partial Dependence where appropriate

---

# Multi-Agent System

Nexora will use a specialized multi-agent architecture orchestrated through **LangGraph**.

| Agent                    | Responsibility                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Supervisor Agent         | Understands the request and orchestrates the workflow            |
| Data Understanding Agent | Understands dataset structure and schema                         |
| Data Quality Agent       | Detects missing values, duplicates, inconsistencies and outliers |
| EDA Agent                | Performs exploratory analysis                                    |
| Statistical Agent        | Performs appropriate statistical analysis                        |
| Visualization Agent      | Selects appropriate visualizations                               |
| Insight Agent            | Converts analytical results into evidence-backed findings        |
| Recommendation Agent     | Converts findings into practical recommendations                 |
| Report Agent             | Generates a professional analysis report                         |

The architecture may evolve as development progresses.

---

```

### Agent Activity

```text
AI Analysis

✓ Supervisor Agent
✓ Data Understanding Agent
✓ Data Quality Agent
✓ EDA Agent
⏳ Statistical Analysis Agent

---

# Example Analysis

Suppose a user uploads:

```text
sales_data.csv
```

and asks:

> **Why did revenue decrease in Q3?**

Nexora could create an analytical workflow:

```text
User Question
      ↓
Supervisor
      ↓
Data Understanding
      ↓
Data Quality
      ↓
EDA
      ↓
Statistical Analysis
      ↓
Visualization
      ↓
Evidence
      ↓
Insight
      ↓
Recommendation
      ↓
Report
```

The final result might contain evidence such as:

```text
Q3 Revenue Analysis

Revenue Change:
-18.4%

Observed Contributors:

West Region
Revenue: -27%

Product Category A
Revenue: -31%

Average Order Quantity
Change: -14%

Trend:
The decline began in July.

Supporting Evidence:
Multiple independent analyses support the finding.

Recommended Investigation:
Review inventory availability, pricing,
and promotional changes in the West region
during July–September.
```

These numbers are only an example.

In the actual application, numerical values must always come from the dataset and controlled Python analysis tools.

The structure is a starting point and may evolve as the architecture becomes more mature.

---

# API Architecture

Planned API structure:

## Dataset

```http
POST /api/datasets/upload
GET  /api/datasets
GET  /api/datasets/{dataset_id}
```

## Analysis

```http
POST /api/analysis/start
GET  /api/analysis/{analysis_id}
GET  /api/analysis/{analysis_id}/status
GET  /api/analysis/{analysis_id}/insights
GET  /api/analysis/{analysis_id}/charts
```

## Reports

```http
POST /api/reports/{analysis_id}/generate
GET  /api/reports/{report_id}
```

The API design may change during implementation.

---

# Database

PostgreSQL will be used for persistent application data.

Planned entities include:

### Users

```text
id
name
email
created_at
```

### Datasets

```text
id
user_id
filename
size
row_count
column_count
upload_time
quality_score
```

### Analysis Jobs

```text

```

### Reports

```text

```

The schema will evolve with the implementation.

---

# Security

Because Nexora will eventually process user-uploaded datasets, security is an important part of the architecture.

Planned protections include:

* File type validation
* File size limits
* Filename sanitization
* Temporary file management
* Input validation
* CORS configuration
* Environment-based secrets
* SQL injection protection
* Resource and execution limits
* Safe analytical tool execution
* API authentication
* Protection against malicious datasets

### Important Rule

> **Nexora must never execute arbitrary Python code supplied by a user.**

---

# Error Handling

The application should gracefully handle:

* Invalid CSV files
* Empty datasets
* Unsupported file types
* Extremely large datasets
* Missing columns
* Corrupted data
* Unsupported statistical analysis
* Model training failures
* LLM API failures
* Agent failures
* Timeouts

Errors should be presented to users in understandable language rather than exposing raw backend exceptions.

---

# Observability

Nexora is intended to provide visibility into the analytical pipeline.

The system will eventually track:

```text
Analysis ID
      ↓
Agent Execution
      ↓
Tool Calls
      ↓
Execution Time
      ↓
Tool Results
      ↓
Failures
      ↓
Generated Findings
```

This will help with debugging, auditing, reproducibility, and understanding how an insight was produced.

---

# Development Principles

The following principles will guide development:

1. **Build incrementally.**
2. **Do not build the entire system at once.**
3. **React + TypeScript remains the primary frontend.**
4. **Python + FastAPI remains the backend.**
5. **Streamlit will not be used as the primary frontend.**
6. **Python performs Data Science calculations.**
7. **LLMs reason about analysis rather than inventing numerical results.**
8. **Important findings should have supporting evidence.**
9. **Correlation should not automatically be interpreted as causation.**
10. **Use Pydantic for structured backend data.**
11. **Keep frontend and backend loosely coupled through APIs.**
12. **Never hard-code API keys.**
13. **Use modular and reusable code.**
14. **Add testing progressively.**
15. **Preserve working functionality when introducing changes.**
16. **Document major architectural decisions.**
17. **Keep the project GitHub-ready throughout development.**
