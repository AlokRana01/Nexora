# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project: Nexora — Autonomous AI for Evidence-Based Data Intelligence
**Document Version:** 1.0.0  
**Status:** Approved / Active Development  
**Target Release:** MVP (Phase 1)  
**Author:** Nexora Core Architecture & Product Team  
**Last Updated:** October 2026

## 1. Executive Summary

**Nexora** is an autonomous AI-powered data intelligence platform designed to transform raw tabular datasets and natural-language business questions into **evidence-backed analysis, statistical insights, interactive visualizations, and actionable recommendations**.

Unlike generic conversational AI chatbots that hallucinate numbers, execute unvetted code, or jump to speculative conclusions, Nexora operates on a fundamental Data Science principle:

> **"The AI reasons about the analysis. Controlled Python tools perform the analysis."**

Nexora orchestrates specialized agentic roles (Supervisor, Data Understanding, Data Quality, EDA, Statistical Analysis, Visualization, Insight, and Recommendation) via **LangGraph**. The agents select from a deterministic library of verified Python Data Science functions (Pandas, SciPy, NumPy, Scikit-learn), preventing LLM calculation hallucinations and guaranteeing reproducible, mathematically sound results.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Organizations and professionals accumulate vast amounts of tabular data (CSVs, Excel files, database dumps) but face severe bottlenecks when trying to extract timely, trustworthy insights:

1. **The Chatbot Hallucination Trap:** Generic LLMs frequently miscalculate sums, invent percentages, misapply aggregations, and present plausible-sounding falsehoods as facts.
2. **The Black-Box Python Code Risk:** Code-interpreter style tools run arbitrary, uncontrolled code that can time out, expose security vulnerabilities, or produce irreproducible artifacts without proper validation.
3. **Statistical Illiteracy:** Standard generative models confuse correlation with causation, ignore data distributions, overlook missing value biases, and fail to perform hypothesis tests before claiming relationships exist.
4. **Data Science Talent Shortage:** Small-to-midsize businesses, product managers, and functional analysts cannot hire dedicated data science teams for every ad-hoc investigative inquiry ("Why did Q3 revenue drop in Europe?").
5. **Disconnected Toolchains:** Existing workflows require switching between Excel, Jupyter Notebooks, BI dashboards (Tableau/PowerBI), and slide presentations, creating days of latency between question and decision.

## 3. Product Vision & Value Proposition

### 3.1 Product Vision
To build an autonomous AI Data Scientist that **actively investigates data** rather than merely talking about it—delivering verifiable, transparent, auditable, and presentation-ready business intelligence on demand.

### 3.2 Value Proposition
* **Zero Math Hallucination:** 100% of numerical calculations and metrics are produced by deterministic Python engines.
* **Evidence-Backed Insights:** Every insight is paired with explicit statistical evidence, sample sizes, and confidence intervals.
* **Controlled Security:** Zero arbitrary code execution; all agent operations use vetted, sandboxed functional tools.
* **Actionable Recommendations:** Moves beyond "what happened" to diagnostic "why it happened" and prescriptive "what to do next".
* **Production-Grade UI:** A modern React/TypeScript workspace with live agent reasoning streams, interactive charts, and instant executive report export.

## 4. Target User Personas

| Persona | Role & Background | Core Pain Point | How Nexora Solves It |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P1: Business Analyst (Priya)** | Data-savvy analyst supporting Marketing and Operations. Proficient in Excel and basic SQL. | Spends 60% of her week cleaning data, running repetitive pivot tables, and drafting basic charts. | Uploads CSVs, asks complex diagnostic questions in plain English, and receives verified charts and bulleted evidence in minutes. |
| **P2: Product Manager (Marcus)** | Non-technical PM tracking user retention, churn, and feature adoption. | Lacks Python/R skills; BI dashboards answer "what" happened, but cannot explain "why" metrics dropped. | Asks root-cause questions ("Why did churn surge for Android users in v2.4?"); Nexora performs multi-variate statistical tests and pinpoints drivers. |
| **P3: Startup Founder / Executive (Elena)** | Seed-stage founder without a dedicated analytics team. | Needs rapid, defensible numbers for investor decks and strategic planning without hiring an expensive agency. | Generates boardroom-ready executive PDF/Markdown reports with audited data sources and actionable strategic next steps. |
| **P4: BI / Data Science Lead (David)** | Senior Data Scientist leading analytics infrastructure. | Skeptical of AI tools due to hallucinations, compliance risks, and lack of statistical rigor. | Inspects the full agent reasoning plan, Python tool execution logs, hypothesis test outputs (p-values, degrees of freedom), and methodology. |

## 8. User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

### US-1: Dataset Upload & Automated Quality Profile
* **As a** Business Analyst,
* **I want to** drag and drop a 50MB CSV file into the workspace,
* **So that** I immediately see column types, missing rates, and potential data quality anomalies without writing manual inspection code.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * Dataset parses within 3 seconds for 100k rows.
  * System displays total rows, columns, memory usage, and missing values breakdown per column.
  * Data Health Score is displayed with clear warning tags for columns with >20% missing values or single-value constants.

### US-2: Natural Language Diagnostic Querying
* **As a** Product Manager,
* **I want to** ask *"Why did conversion rate drop in September compared to August?"*,
* **So that** the AI identifies the exact segments or features responsible rather than giving generic advice.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * Supervisor agent decomposes the query into date filtering, group aggregation by dimension (e.g., channel, device), and statistical t-test.
  * UI displays real-time execution steps as agents invoke tools.
  * Output clearly identifies the primary driver (e.g., "Mobile Safari conversion dropped 42%, $p < 0.001$, while Desktop remained unchanged").

### US-3: Zero-Hallucination Statistical Evidence
* **As a** BI Lead,
* **I want to** verify the mathematical proof behind an insight,
* **So that** I can confidently defend the findings in an executive review.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * Every insight card includes an expandable "Evidence & Proof" panel.
  * Panel displays exact sample size ($N$), test statistic ($t$, $\chi^2$, or $F$), $p$-value, and the exact Python tool parameters used.
  * No numerical value appears in the LLM text that is not present in the tool execution result JSON.

### US-4: Exportable Executive Report
* **As a** Startup Founder,
* **I want to** export the full analysis session into a branded PDF or Markdown document,
* **So that** I can share findings directly with stakeholders and investors.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  * Report includes Title, Executive Summary, Key Findings, Charts, Methodology, and Next Steps.
  * PDF generation renders cleanly with no clipped charts or broken formatting.

## 10. Assumptions, Risks & Mitigation Strategies

| Risk / Assumption | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Assumption:** Datasets have clean headers and tabular format. | Medium | High | Implement robust parsing fallback with encoding detection (`chardet`), header inference, and whitespace stripping. |
| **Risk: LLM Tool Selection Error:** Agent selects incorrect columns or inappropriate statistical test. | High | Medium | Enforce strict Pydantic schemas, column name fuzzy-matching, and supervisor validation gates before tool invocation. |
| **Risk: Large Dataset Memory Overhead:** Uploading large CSVs causes Out-Of-Memory (OOM) on backend server. | High | Low | Enforce 50MB file size limit for MVP; use streaming file upload and chunked Polars/Pandas reading. |
| **Risk: LLM Rate Limiting or Provider Outage:** Provider API fails during multi-step graph execution. | Medium | Medium | Support interchangeable LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) via unified LangChain interface with automatic exponential backoff retry. |
| **Risk: Over-interpretation of Spurious Correlations:** System misleads users into thinking correlation implies causation. | High | Medium | Enforce system-prompt guardrails and UI warning badges explicitly distinguishing correlation from causal claims. |
